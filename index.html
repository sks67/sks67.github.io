										<p>I am interested in understanding the different ways in which Type Ia and Core-collapse SNe can be formed by studying supernova remnants in our Local Group galaxies - the Magellanic Clouds, M31 and M33. Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are the leftover plasma of hot gas and expelled stellar material from the supernova. These objects are numerous in the Local Group, and can be modelled as an effective 'SN survey'. This allows us to directly study them relative to their 'resolved' progenitor stellar population, which have been surveyed in great detail using ground-based optical and the Hubble space telescope.

											<h3>Modelling Supernova Remnant Populations</h3>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/ModellingSNRs.jpg" alt="" /></a>

											<p>I have led the development of a statistical model of supernova remnant populations in the Local Group galaxies. The model combines key elements of particle acceleration physics in SNR shocks, and large multi-wavelength datasets to trace the associated ISM and stellar populations. With the observational constraint from radio SNR catalogs, the model provides a statistical estimate of visibility times (the duration of visibility in a survey), which will be useful to calculate DTDs in the Local Group. </p>

	<h3>Radio-Continuum based Supernova Remnant Catalogs</h3>										
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										
											<p>I am assisting Daniel Huizenga, Jessica Maldonado and Dr. Laura Chomiuk to compile a radio-continuum selected catalog of SNRs in the Local Group galaxies. I am currently reducing EVLA data collected since 2010 on the M31 bulge using AIPS. This pipeline will also be used to image the bulk disk of M31.

											<h3>Supernova Delay-Time Distribution in the Local Group</h3>
										  <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									
											<p>The delay-time distribution is the hypothetical rate of an event in stellar evolution (e.g. supernovae) measured after a brief burst of star-formation. It encodes the observed timescales on which these events occur for different progenitor channels, and therefore serve as a powerful, statistical constraint on theoretical models. The DTD can be measured from a survey of objects (SNe) and a set of star-formation histories. The advantage of a Local Group DTD is that the star-formation history will be based on resolved stellar populations, unlike star-formation histories in extra-galactic surveys which are based on integrated spectra and possibly carry unknown systematic biases. By treating a supernova remnant (SNR) survey as an effective SN survey, we can combine these measurements to produce a high-quality DTD, free from the biases of integrated spectra.</p>

	<h3>Probing the onset of the SNR phase with SN1885a and G1.9+0.3</h3>										
	<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										
											<p>These young objects of around 100 years fall in between the oldest known SN and the youngest SNR (Cas A), providing observational constraints on these poorly-understood phase of SNR evolution.</p>
